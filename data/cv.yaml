Work:
  - Entity: Critical Shift
    From: Jun 2024
    To: Present
    Title: Co-founder, Engineer
    ShortDescription: Critical Shift builds specialized technical products at the intersection
      of hardware, software, data, and security. We focus on bringing automation and efficiency
      to businesses through products that respond to the needs of an entire industry.

  - Entity: Yubico
    From: Nov 2017
    To: Jun 2024
    Title: Staff Software Engineer
    ShortDescription: Lead or engaged in several cross-company initiatives
      ranging from improving Yubico's developer documentation, to improving
      manufacturing, to exploring new product opportunities.
    Description: >
      As a staff software engineer, I was not limited to a single project. I helped
      bring ideas and initiatives to fruition by influencing company leadership,
      connecting individuals, and providing a cohesive vision. I sought opportunities
      to increase efficiency, reduce technical debt and burden, and lift my team through
      mentorship and guidance.


      The last publicly announced project of which I had contributed was Yubico's FIDO2
      pre-registration initiative in partnership with Okta. FIDO2 pre-registration
      reduces the friction for employees of companies using Okta + YubiKey by creating a
      credit-card like experience. Your company's IT staff only need register a user with a
      FIDO factor in Okta, and Yubico will deliver a pre-configured key directly to your employee.
      Once received, your employee can access your internal apps using the strongest form
      of authentication.

  - Entity: Yubico
    From: Dec 2020
    To: Dec 2021
    Title: Software Engineering Manager
    ShortDescription:
      Oversaw the teams responsible for developing Yubico's .NET SDK
      as well as our manufacturing and supply chain software.
    Description: >
      Grew the team's headcount to properly staff all efforts and oversaw the promotion of
      several team members.


      After a full year of management, I learned that I am a leader - not a manager. I felt
      that I could better fulfill that role as an individual contributor.

  - Entity: Microsoft
    From: Jun 2008
    To: Nov 2017
    Title: Software Development Engineer
    ShortDescription: Worked in the Core OS group (Windows) developing storage
      management and backup technologies. Was the original principal author of
      the Windows Storage PowerShell cmdlets.
    Description: >
      **Universal Windows Platform - Storage APIs**

      - Added secure mechanism for file source attribution, allowing low and high privileged
        apps to negotiate the trust level of a file

      - Removed MAX_PATH limitations from both Win32 and Windows Runtime file + directory APIs,
        effectively bringing long path support to the Windows platform

      - Enlightened key Win32 file and directory APIs to the Universal Windows Platform app sandbox,
        enabling developers to bring their existing code into the Windows Store directly (without
        relying on the "desktop bridge")


      **Storage Management + Storage Spaces**

      - Designed and implemented WMI management APIs for managing Storage Area Networks, Storage Spaces,
      and locally attached disks and volumes

      - Designed and implemented PowerShell cmdlets that allows for IT Pro management of storage

      - Created proprietary algorithm to make management of storage accessible to Windows Clusters
        completely transparent to developers and IT pros.

      - Created diagnostic tool that gathers and packages all relevant data to diagnose storage faults
        on both standalone and clustered systems. The tool is resilient enough to work even when cluster
        quorum has been lost, yet easy enough to use that a support engineer need only send a single line
        of instruction to a customer


      **Volume Shadow-copy Service**

      - Co-wrote LUN Resync feature allowing enterprise customers to recover data instantly without sacrificing
        their backup

      - Contributor to the "Windows Internal Library", a C++ library enabling internal Windows developers to
        write correct code with higher productivity

Volunteering:
  - Entity: Kennett Classic
    From: Mar 2023
    To: Present
    Title: Docent

      Kennett Classic is a vintage computer gallery and museum. I

  - Entity: MEOW Cat Rescue
    From: Feb 2014
    To: Present
    Title: Adoption counselor, Foster, IT consultant
    ShortDescription: Facilitated adoption of cats, lead shelter shifts, hospice
      fostered our cats in need. Additionally provided technological guidance
      and support to the shelter staff.
    Description: >
      **MEOW "Buddy"**


      - Socialize the cats that are in our cat condos, allowing them some unhindered play time.

      - Observe the temperament of each cat to provide additional notes to the adoption counselors and
        other volunteers that might better help facilitate adoption.


      **9th Life / Medical Foster**


      MEOW is a no-kill shelter, we take care of our own cats, even if we know they are ill and no longer
      adoptable. As a medical foster, I would:

      - Care for cats with mild to moderate medical issues.

      - Provide a quiet and stable home to help speed along their recovery.

      - Coordinate care with the shelter's medical coordinator. When necessary, take them to their veterinary
        appointments and checkups.

      - Provide them with medical care at home. This would include giving oral and subcutaneous medicines and fluids,
        syringe feeding, and even supplemental oxygen in one extraordinary case.

      As a 9th life foster, I would take in cats with moderate to severe terminal medical issues. In addition to
      the responsibilities of a medical foster, I would also:

      - Provide a stable and loving home for them to enjoy their remaining days - whether that be days or years.

      - Work with our medical coordinator to monitor the foster's condition and help make the unfortunate tough
        call when it was clear they were in too much pain to ethically continue life extending care.

      Between each foster, I would allow myself time to grieve and recover from the loss. Despite the heavy
      emotional toll, providing this care has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.


      **Adoption counselor**


      I would work with the public to help match them with a cat. While the end goal is an
      adoption, it was also my responsibility to make sure we were placing the cat into a safe environment and
      that the adoption had high potential of long-term success. MEOW places strict requirements on adoptions,
      such as requiring the cat to stay indoors at all times, kittens not to be adopted by themselves or into
      homes with very young children, etc. This sometimes resulted in some very difficult conversations. It was
      also my role to educate the public on the adoption process, the best practices for cat care, and to answer
      any questions they might have.


      **Shift lead**


      I would oversee an entire day's volunteer shift during the public hours of the shelter. I would
      delegate tasks amongst the volunteers to make sure the shelter was running smoothly and was a welcoming
      environment at all times. I was also responsible for training and mentoring the other volunteers, especially
      the adoption counselors, on the adoption process. I also signed off on all adoption applications and would
      help make the tough calls on whether or not an applicant was appropriate given our shelter's policies.


      **IT consultant**


      Maintained a set of about 10 on-site computers within the shelter, along with the file server
      and software that was used by the shelter staff.
