## Background

I collect "retro" or "vintage" computers, video game systems, and electronics. I'm always on the lookout for good deals or to simply help someone to clear out their attic.

- Want to avoid the hassle of shipping?
- Or the costs associated with shipping, eBay, and payment processors?
- Have an item that holds sentimental value that you want to make sure ends up in a collector's home who will appreciate it and restore it to its former glory?

Then I hope you will consider working with me in getting your item(s) into a good home.

**What I'm looking for, generally:**

Please reach out to me if you have any of the following specific items in the list below. These items are for my own collection; I do not ask for duplicates (with the exception of accessories like keyboards and monitors, of course) and I do *NOT* resell these listed items!! The one exception is if you are offering me a lot of games or accessories, I may list duplicate items for a fair price on Facebook Marketplace or offer them to other local collectors for free. I like to be fair!

I am also willing to consider as-is or untested systems depending on the visible condition of the unit and whether or not I'm looking for spare parts.

If you're looking to generally re-home other old electronics such as computers, CRT TV's or monitors, game systems and games, or audio equipment, I'm happy to take them. Don't give them to a place like Goodwill - they won't know what to do with them. Any general lots like this I will sort through. Whatever I don't keep will be sold to other collectors and half of the proceeds will be donated to the local non-profit https://www.kennettclassic.com/ Computer Museum. I want to make sure we're supporting our local community - not large national entities!

***Special note:*** Please also be sure to check out my "Unobtainium" list. These items are not just on the list because they are rare and valuable, but because they *mean* something to me. There are stories behind why I want them. I'm willing to negotiate way more on terms to acquire the items. Even sharing leads or information is appreciated. And I'm always happy to share my stories.

**How to contact me:**

Please contact me at: gregslist (dot) 3suvv (at) simplelogin (dot) com

This is a privacy email address that will occasionally rotate depending on how much spam it brings in. Those 5 random characters are what will likely change over time. Obviously replace (dot) with . and (at) with @.

**Where I'm willing to travel:**

I am located near West Grove, PA in Chester County. I am willing to travel 20-40 miles for most systems, typically on Fridays or the weekend. For certain special items, I may consider traveling further, especially if you're willing to meet me along the way.

**How I handle payment:**

I will only meet at public facilities that are open on the day of the transaction. I will use Paypal, Venmo, CashApp, or Apple Pay. I can pay cash for items less than $100. I will _never_ carry more than $100 cash on me, sorry!

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to our transactions!
