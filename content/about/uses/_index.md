# Hardware, software, tools, etc. that I use

I use all sorts of technology - whether that be for work, fun, or because it's necessary. Oh, and I'm also very opinionated. Here I share the hardware, software, tools, etc. that I use on a regular basis. I've provided links to the manufacturer page or to where you can make a purchase. Not every item is still available, however. In those cases I've linked to the closest equivalents I could find.

Additionally, when getting into software, I've linked out where appropriate to my `dotfiles` Git repository so that you can easily deploy and configure these tools as well. Lastly, be sure to check out my "books" and blog posts for more detailed info and adventures in using this technology.

    I love a full sized keyboard. I need my numpad, not to mention proper Home/End, PageUp/PageDown keys. The Cherry MX Clears are the heavier counterpart to the Browns. A lovely tactile, non-clicky switch that provides a little bit of extra resistance to thwart "fat-finger" typos that I tend to make otherwise.

    Nothing particularly special about this mouse other than it has a shape that fits my hand pretty well. The mouse wheel can operate in both a glide and a step-wise fashion. The mouse also comes with additional weights to adjust the overall feel, but I have thus far left it in the stock configuration.

  {{< fancylistitem Title="KRK VXT4 w/ 10\" Subwoofer" Subtitle="Speakers" Href="https://www.krkmusic.com/Studio-Monitors/V4" >}}

    For a reasonably entry-level studio monitor speaker, these pack quite the punch for sound. Especially when the subwoofer is being used. These particular speakers (the VXT4s) are no longer made and have been replaced by the V4s which are what is linked. It looks like they have updated the amplifier to class D which is probably good - the amps on mine tend to pick up a lot of EMF, requiring me to carefully route cables and run them through power conditioners.

    I will likely be switching over to my much nicer Genelec monitors soon.

    The Framework is definitely the new cool kid in town. This little 13" laptop packs a punch and is equipped with one of the nicest feeling laptop keyboards I have ever used. Supports Linux quite well with only minimal extra configuration needed. (This may well be taken care of in the latest distro releases.) The swappable expansion slots are an amazing idea - something which I plan to take more advantage of when I have the time to tinker more with hardware design.

    A nice sign-on gift that Yubico gives their employees. These wireless Bluetooth over-the-ear headphones are comfortable indeed. The noise cancellation makes them ideal for the long airplane trips to and from Europe. The sound quality is a bit boomy on the bass, but honestly, I kind of like that. They sound great. Just don't try to use them as a communication headset. You will be disappointed.

  {{< fancylistitem Title="AMERIGUY 150W Charging Station" Subtitle="Power adapter" Href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Delivery-Station-Laptop-MacBook/dp/B08YY5XG4N">}}

    This is just your typical Chinese brand power adapter which is apparently no longer being sold. But the one I have has been solid. It has 2x USB-C and 2x USB-A, capable of charging my Framework, my iPad Pro, my iPhone, and Apple Watch simultaneously without breaking a sweat. There is a power cord out the back which reduces the strain on outlets. (I'm looking at you MacBook chargers...) Additionally, the power cord is your standard IEC C5 type connector, which means I can swap out my American type plugs with European ones while travelling.
