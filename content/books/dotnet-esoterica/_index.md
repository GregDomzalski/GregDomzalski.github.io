.NET Esoterica is a living book. It serves as the lost documentation and reference manuals that I wish I had when I began my journey learning some of the more esoteric features and extension points of .NET. Everything in here focuses on the latest .NET technologies - so .NET 7+, not .NET Framework. The only time .NET Framework topics will be covered is when our goal is to target .NET Standard 2.0 (in the case of Source Generators) or we are aiming to create a library that is compatible with the widest audience possible.

Granted, I am still learning new things about these topics every day. Hence, a living book. Contents subject to change.
