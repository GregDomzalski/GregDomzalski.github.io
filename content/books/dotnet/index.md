# .NET Esoterica

.NET Esoterica is a living book. It serves as the lost documentation and reference manuals that I wish I had when I began my journey learning some of the more esoteric features and extension points of .NET.

Granted, I am still learning new things about these topics every day. Hence, a living book.

Topics covered:

- Roslyn syntax and symbol APIs
- Source generators
- The SDK-based project system
- Native interop
