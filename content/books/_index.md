Title = "Books, Guides, Manuals, etc."
+++

I call this section "Books" for lack of a better term. These are essentially my notes for various things that I've collected and curated over the years - and continue to do so. Some topics may be covered in brief by other blog posts, but here I can give them more structure. Some may read like books or reference manuals, others may be more informal like guides and how-to's.
