# Software, tools, and other things I recommend

I get asked a lot about the things I use to build software, stay productive, or buy to fool myself into thinking I’m being productive when I’m really just procrastinating. Here’s a big list of all of my favorite stuff.

- Workstation
  - Custom build, AMD Zen4, AMD 7900XT, 128GB RAM, Linux
  - LG 32" Display
  - Code Keyboard w/ CherryMX Clear switches
