Hello you. I have no idea who you are. Right now I'm not really sure who my intended audience will be. Most likely like-minded high-tech individuals like myself. Or maybe not? Time will tell.

I've had several false starts at setting up a blog and an online presence. But this time it feels different. Practice over the years has made writing, especially technical writing, a little easier for me. It doesn't mean I'm any good at it. I think I'll need a _lot_ more practice before that happens. But at least now I finally feel like I have things I'd like to write about. As I mature in my career and I desire to understand things in more depth, I'm finding that not a lot is being written about the topics I want to learn about. At the very minimum, the content is scattered amongst other blogs and is perhaps hard to find or follow.

So this website, as a whole, is not just to showcase my work and portfolio. It's to serve as a place for me to write down all of the things that I've learned and share it with you all. Things like how the .NET source generators works. Or how I've slowly been building up my `dotfiles` for bootstrapping my workstations. Or the home automation and home labbing that I've been doing over the years. I figure, if it is interesting to me, it may be interesting to someone else. And if it took me a long time to learn and comprehend, then maybe I can offer a fresh perspective that may be more approachable than your standard tech blogger.

I'm glad to finally be contributing _something_ back to my field. So much of my work has been proprietary - working on Windows Storage, and then on various projects within Yubico. (Although the [YubiKey's .NET SDK](https://github.com/Yubico/Yubico.NET.SDK) that I spearheaded is open source, so that's fun!)
