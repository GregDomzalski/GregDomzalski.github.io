                <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                    I am the co-founder and lead software engineer at Critical Shift, a company focused on delivering
                    unique and innovative products that can only be built from a deep understanding of how hardware,
                    software, data, and security intersect. We lead by example by sharing our own learnings and creativity
                    with others as we continually evolve to solve increasingly bigger and more complex problems.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Beyond work, I still love to tinker and build. My interests include: compiler design, restoring and
                    using vintage computers, home automation and home-labbing, and more. But I'm not always in front of
                    a screen. I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, being bossed around by my cat, volunteering,
                    and staying active.
